# mickeyf.com — BeatCalc Web App

mickeyf.com is an interactive music-and-math platform with games, animations,
educational resources, authentication, and leaderboards.

## Documentation

The generated TypeDoc site is published at
[good-loops.github.io/mickeyf.com](https://good-loops.github.io/mickeyf.com/).
It covers the frontend and backend modules and is updated from `main` by the
documentation workflow.
Pull requests that change documentation inputs build the site for validation,
while only `main` can publish it.

The active cross-project roadmap is tracked in [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md).

## Technology

- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Sass, and Vite
- Backend: Node.js, Express, and MySQL
- Unity game: Unity 6.3 LTS (6000.3.8f1), 2D URP, and the Input System
- Hosting: Firebase Hosting and Google Cloud Run
- Database: Cloud SQL for MySQL
- Local database connectivity: Cloud SQL Auth Proxy in Docker Desktop

The application processes run with native Node.js. Docker is used only for
local infrastructure.

## Native Windows development

Native Windows 11 is the supported development environment. The checkout can
live in any local folder; the commands below assume this repository root:

```text
<path-to-your-checkout>\mickeyf.com
```

### Prerequisites

- Git for Windows
- Node.js 22.15 or newer, but lower than 23 (CI/runtime pinned at 22.23.2), and
  npm 11.6.2
- Visual Studio Code for Windows
- Docker Desktop using Linux containers
- Google Cloud CLI when local Cloud SQL access is needed
- Unity Hub and Unity 6.3 LTS editor version 6000.3.8f1 for Three Bosses

### Install dependencies

Open PowerShell in the repository root and run:

```powershell
$env:NODE_USE_SYSTEM_CA = "1"
npm ci
npm --prefix frontend ci
npm --prefix backend ci
```

`NODE_USE_SYSTEM_CA=1` keeps TLS verification enabled while allowing Node and
npm to use the trusted certificates from Windows. Do not disable npm's strict
SSL verification.

These are three independent npm projects; the repository does not use npm
workspaces.

### Configure local environment files

Create the ignored local files when they do not already exist:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
Copy-Item frontend\.env.example frontend\.env
```

Fill in the required local values. Never commit `.env`, `frontend/.env`,
database credentials, session secrets, Firebase credentials, or ADC files.

The tracked `compose.yaml` expects the Cloud SQL connection name in the root
`.env`:

```text
CLOUD_SQL_CONNECTION_NAME=project:region:instance
```

p4-Vega score writes use a fail-closed runtime gate. Missing, blank, or any
value other than the exact lowercase string `true` keeps submissions frozen
with HTTP 503 `SUBMISSIONS_FROZEN`; login, signup, and leaderboard reads remain
available. Set this only in the untracked local `.env` when score-write testing
is intentional:

```text
P4_VEGA_SCORE_SUBMISSIONS_ENABLED=true
```

Three Bosses uses a separate fail-closed gate. Its leaderboard remains readable
while run submission is disabled. Set the exact lowercase value `true` only for
intentional local endpoint/bridge testing; the Unity submit control remains a
separate release gate:

```text
THREE_BOSSES_RUN_SUBMISSIONS_ENABLED=true
```

When that gate is open, a normal run first obtains a short-lived, signed ticket
from `POST /api/leaderboards/three-bosses/run-tickets`. The browser keeps the
ticket in memory and presents it with the matching completion. The backend
binds it to the authenticated user, run ID, contract, and rules version; checks
that the reported active-combat time is possible within elapsed wall time; and
then derives score and rank itself. Tickets expire after 30 minutes and runs
shorter than 10 seconds are rejected. This is a proportionate Alpha integrity
check, not server-authoritative anti-cheat: a modified client can still report
a plausible slower time.

On native Windows, Compose finds the ADC file under `%APPDATA%` automatically.
Set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_HOST` in `.env` only to override that
location; use forward slashes in an override path. Create or refresh
Application Default Credentials interactively when required:

```powershell
gcloud auth application-default login
```

The ADC file is mounted read-only into the proxy container and must never be
copied into Git.

### Start development

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. Open the native Windows folder in VS Code:

   ```powershell
   code .
   ```

3. Review the tracked VS Code configuration, trust the repository, and install
   the recommended extensions when VS Code prompts. See
   [`.vscode/README.md`](.vscode/README.md) for the extension and MCP security
   boundaries. The tracked terminal layout then starts four terminals whenever
   the repository opens:

   - `front`, running the frontend Vite server and local Three Bosses WebGL
     asset server with a cyan browser icon;
   - `back`, starting the pinned Cloud SQL Auth Proxy, backend compiler/watch,
     and nodemon server together with prefixed logs and a red server icon;
   - `docs`, running the TypeDoc development server with a green book icon; and
   - `general`, running Copilot CLI in Git Bash at the repository root with the
     historical orange terminal tint (`terminal.ansiBlue` in the Monokai
     Spectrum theme).

The tracked `.vscode/restore-terminals.json` owns the automatic layout. The
existing `Infrastructure: up`, `Backend: dev`, `Backend: watch`, and
`Backend: dev + watch` entries remain available from `Terminal: Run Task` for
granular recovery. `Backend: local stack` starts the combined backend terminal,
and `Development: app` starts that local stack together with the frontend.

The equivalent manual commands, each in its own terminal, are:

```powershell
npm --prefix frontend run dev
npm run backend:dev:local
npm run docs:dev
```

Default local ports are:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend: `http://localhost:8080`
- Cloud SQL Proxy: `127.0.0.1:3306`
- TypeDoc server: `http://localhost:8081`
- Three Bosses WebGL assets (started with frontend development):
  `http://127.0.0.1:4174`

If port 8080 is occupied, identify its owning process before stopping it. The
backend start command deliberately does not kill unrelated processes.

### Documentation development

Run the `docs` VS Code task or:

```powershell
npm run docs:dev
```

`docs:dev` watches for changes and serves the existing `docs/` output. For an
initial build before watching/serving, use `npm run docs:dev:fresh`. Review any
generated Git diff and do not commit it accidentally.

To regenerate one package's documentation JSON, run `npm run docs:json:frontend`
or `npm run docs:json:backend` from the repository root. These root commands own
the shared documentation pipeline; there are no package-local `docs:json` aliases.

### Three Bosses WebGL development and Alpha packaging

Three Bosses is available locally when the development feature flag is
explicitly enabled. Its Alpha release uses a separate, certified same-origin
package. The playable route is desktop-only for Alpha 0.6.0; recognized mobile
browsers receive the desktop-only notice without instantiating Unity, while the
Three Bosses leaderboard remains available.

1. Build the Unity project to the external, ignored location documented in
   [`unity/three-bosses/README.md`](unity/three-bosses/README.md).
2. Add this untracked local setting to `frontend/.env.development.local`:

   ```dotenv
   VITE_ENABLE_THREE_BOSSES_LOCAL=1
   ```

3. Start the frontend development stack:

   ```powershell
   npm --prefix frontend run dev
   ```

   This command supervises Vite and the loopback WebGL asset server together,
   so stopping either process stops the pair. The standalone
   `npm run three-bosses:webgl:serve` command remains available for focused
   server recovery and debugging.

4. Open `http://localhost:5173/games/three-bosses`.

In development, the frontend proxies generated assets through
`/__local/three-bosses/`; the local build remains outside the repository and
the generated manifest discovers the current Unity filenames.

Prepare the releasable package only from clean, committed Unity source and an
automated, ready, stopped Editor:

```powershell
npm run three-bosses:webgl:release:build
npm run three-bosses:webgl:package
npm run three-bosses:webgl:release:validate
```

The release build stays under `%LOCALAPPDATA%`; packaging copies only the
certified, content-addressed runtime into
`frontend/public/unity/three-bosses/`. Do not hand-edit those packaged files.
Production enables the route with `VITE_ENABLE_THREE_BOSSES_RELEASE=1`. Unity
emits uncompressed runtime files so Firebase Hosting can negotiate Brotli or
gzip itself while supplying the required WebAssembly, CSP, MIME, and cache
headers. Publishing the game does not enable score writes: the backend's
independent `THREE_BOSSES_RUN_SUBMISSIONS_ENABLED=true` opt-in must be reviewed
and activated separately. Alpha 0.6.0 activates them together only after the
fresh packaged player, authenticated run-ticket round trip, leaderboard
readback, and production preview have all passed.

### Stop development

Stop the active VS Code tasks with `Terminal: Terminate Task` or `Ctrl+C`, then
stop the proxy:

```powershell
npm run infra:down
```

### Checks and production builds

```powershell
npm run docs
npm --prefix frontend run test
npm --prefix frontend run build
npm --prefix backend run test
npm --prefix backend run test:unit
npm --prefix backend run test:migrations
npm --prefix backend run prod
```

The migration integration suite starts its own digest-pinned MySQL 8.0.31
container on a dynamically assigned `127.0.0.1` port and destroys it after the
tests. It never uses the Cloud SQL proxy on port 3306 or the runtime `DB_*`
variables; concurrent worktrees receive separate Compose projects and ports.

The migration CLI uses only dedicated `MIGRATION_DB_*` variables. Its
`migrations:plan` command is read-only. Schema mutations require their own
action-specific gate. Ordinary `migrations:apply` may apply only additive
table migrations; it cannot execute migration `0003`. The legacy rollback,
backfill, and standalone reconciliation commands were retired after the
production cutover. Every privileged command requires `MIGRATION_CONFIRM_DATABASE`
to exactly match `MIGRATION_DB_NAME`. These checks run before a database socket
is opened. `MIGRATION_CONFIRM_TARGET` must also exactly match
`127.0.0.1:<port>/<database>`; remote unencrypted database hosts are rejected,
so production use goes through the authenticated local Cloud SQL proxy:

```powershell
npm --prefix backend run migrations:plan
npm --prefix backend run migrations:apply
npm --prefix backend run migrations:p4-drop:plan
npm --prefix backend run migrations:p4-drop:verify
npm --prefix backend run migrations:p4-drop:apply
```

The three `p4-drop` commands own the irreversible `users.p4_score` migration.
Their deterministic plan binds the exact migration checksum, database account,
production server UUID, schema state, and final identity-free reconciliation.
Apply additionally requires the pinned Cloud SQL target, reviewed plan digest,
frozen generic-only revision, exact destructive confirmation, and a live check
that the schema-incompatible `main` build trigger is disabled. Explicit
`ALGORITHM=INSTANT` prevents a silent table-copy fallback. Production migration
`0003_drop_users_p4_score` completed on 2026-08-26. Verify reports the applied
state; another apply is refused before DDL because the irreversible step is
already complete.

Runtime-account privilege reduction has its own fail-closed workflow:

```powershell
npm --prefix backend run runtime-grants:plan
npm --prefix backend run runtime-grants:verify
npm --prefix backend run runtime-grants:apply
```

`plan` inventories every direct privilege channel, the runtime account's lock,
password-expiration and partial-revoke state, each role/default role, and each
proxy relationship without changing grants. It emits the exact
expected `cloudsqlsuperuser@%` to no-database-roles transition, the fixed Cloud
SQL target, the independently observed production server UUID, ordered
operations, blockers, and a deterministic SHA-256. `verify` exits 0 only after
the account has exactly the manifest and no
role; drift exits 2. Unexpected direct privileges, roles, grant/admin options,
proxy relationships, account flags, global role settings, unsupported server
metadata, or a duplicate account name block with zero planned mutations. The
tool deliberately does not guess how to clean them up.

All three commands require the normal exact database, loopback target,
maintenance account, effective `PROCESS` visibility, and
`MIGRATION_CONFIRM_RUNTIME_ACCOUNT=cms_mickeyf@%` confirmations. `apply`
additionally requires the exact reviewed role, Cloud SQL
project/instance/connection name, literal
`cloudsqlsuperuser@% -> no database roles` transition, traffic-drained
confirmation, plan SHA-256, server UUID, and
`MIGRATION_ALLOW_RUNTIME_GRANTS=1`. Before opening MySQL, it independently
verifies the fixed Cloud SQL instance and refuses while any Cloud SQL operation
is unfinished. The MySQL connection must then match the pinned production UUID.
Before its first grant write and again immediately before role removal, it
proves effective `PROCESS` access and zero runtime sessions. It grants and
proves the complete direct manifest, clears the approved default role, rechecks
Cloud SQL operations, and uses Cloud SQL's synchronous zero-role replacement
before proving the final metadata. It never uses `REVOKE ALL`, removes an
unknown role, alters the shared role, changes a
password, or kills a session. Cloud SQL documents the zero-role replacement in
its [database-role procedure](https://docs.cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-users#replace_database_roles_for_an_existing_user).

MySQL privilege and role changes are not one transaction. A failed run can
therefore leave the safe prepared state: the direct grants installed, the
broad role still assigned, and its default activation cleared. Drain traffic,
inspect any Cloud SQL operation still in flight, generate a new plan, and only
then retry. A timeout or aborted `gcloud` process is explicitly indeterminate;
the next apply cannot proceed while Cloud SQL reports an unfinished operation.
Completion also requires a fresh runtime connection and positive and negative
application probes; metadata verification is not evidence that a
previously pooled session disappeared. No production privilege change was made
when this local workflow was added.

Every command requires `MIGRATION_DB_HOST=127.0.0.1`, `MIGRATION_DB_PORT`,
`MIGRATION_DB_NAME`, `MIGRATION_DB_USER`, `MIGRATION_DB_PASS`, and the exact
`CURRENT_USER()` value in `MIGRATION_CONFIRM_ACCOUNT`; there is no fallback to
the backend's runtime `DB_*` credentials. Optional bounded settings are
`MIGRATION_ADVISORY_LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 5),
`MIGRATION_LOCK_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 10), and
`MIGRATION_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 30000). p4 drop planning and apply
also accept `MIGRATION_P4_VEGA_OPERATION_TIMEOUT_MS` (default 900000) for their
bounded exact reconciliation. Set an action gate only for the command being
reviewed, then remove it from the shell after the command. After connecting,
the CLI also verifies that `DATABASE()` and
the complete account returned by `CURRENT_USER()` match those confirmations.

The completed production cutover followed the phased order
in [`backend/LEADERBOARD_DESIGN.md`](backend/LEADERBOARD_DESIGN.md):

1. Verify and record the proxy's exact project, region, and instance first;
   then record a fresh named backup and point-in-time-recovery evidence.
2. Supply one approved maintenance credential only through `MIGRATION_DB_*`,
   confirm its complete account, plan, apply only the additive schema, clear the
   action gate, and plan again. Do not alter `users.p4_score`.
3. Use the committed runtime grant manifest in
   `backend/ts/security/runtimeGrantManifest.ts` as the only intended end-state
   grant source. Do not replace it with improvised grants.
4. Deploy the freeze-capable dual writer, drain legacy-only revisions, then run
   the separately gated monotonic backfill and aggregate reconciliation.
5. For cutover, freeze submissions, drain in-flight dual writers, reconcile,
   deploy the generic-only writer still frozen, drain again, and reconcile
   again. Then retire the two legacy column grants, verify the generic-only
   manifest, and only then enable generic submissions. This one-time grant step
   completed on 2026-08-26 and its dedicated operator commands were removed.
6. Clear credentials and close the proxy. Drop and prove absence of an ephemeral
   maintenance account; if it is intentionally persistent, rotate and govern it
   as an administrator. Keep `users.p4_score` until its separately approved
   post-cutover drop migration.

The runtime manifest is deliberately render-only: importing it opens no
connection and changes no privilege. It grants only the columns used by the
application on `users`, `game_runs`, and `game_personal_bests`; it grants
nothing on `schema_migrations`, no `DELETE` or DDL, no role, and no grant
option. The isolated MySQL 8.0.31 suite installs those grants on a disposable
runtime user and a `users` table without `p4_score`, exercises the current
signup, login, p4-Vega, and Three Bosses SQL paths, and proves that user-row
`FOR UPDATE`, migration history, ledger mutation, destructive DML, DDL, account
creation, and grant operations are denied. Both game repositories use the same
database-scoped per-user advisory lock, so the generic-only manifest grants no
`UPDATE` on `users` and no access to `p4_score`.

The separately approved production reduction completed on 2026-08-26 using the
previous transitional manifest. The subsequent exact grant retirement also
completed on 2026-08-26: `cms_mickeyf@%` now has no database role and exactly the
generic-only source manifest, with no `p4_score` access. Fresh runtime probes
proved ordinary `users` access still works while `p4_score` and migration
history are denied. The retired frozen dual writer is therefore no longer a
valid rollback target.

The frozen generic-only revision
`mickeyf-org-freeze-d5aee625983b4dafa90d0db9898341e8` was deployed and fully
smoke-tested at zero traffic on 2026-08-26. Its temporary public tag and one-use
trigger were removed. Under separate approval, etag-bound traffic-only PATCH
operation `8b0c18a8-805f-494d-97e5-d8523bc10c03` advanced Cloud Run exactly once
to generation 121 and routed 100% to that exact frozen generic-only revision.
The frozen dual writer is now `Active=False`, reason `Retired`. The public
read/freeze contract passed, the drain exceeded its 300-second request timeout,
two delayed old-revision log reads found zero requests after the traffic
observation, two runtime transaction samples were zero, and final reconciliation
again matched all five p4-Vega rows with no discrepancy. The temporary
maintenance user was deleted and negative authentication verified. The two
legacy `p4_score` column grants have since been retired; `users.p4_score` itself
was dropped by checksum-recorded migration `0003` on 2026-08-26 after backup
`1787787054951`. Post-drop schema verification and both public leaderboard
contracts passed with the same five scores, and the temporary maintenance
identity was deleted. The later p4-Vega activation is recorded below.
Exact evidence is recorded in
[`backend/LEADERBOARD_DESIGN.md`](backend/LEADERBOARD_DESIGN.md).

On 2026-08-26, traffic-only operation
`a54a5387-f780-44a9-b38d-d333db988cca` promoted the enabled p4-Vega revision
`mickeyf-org-p4-enabled-d5aee625` to 100% at Cloud Run generation 124. The
revision uses the already verified generic-only image digest; p4-Vega writes
are enabled while Three Bosses writes remain disabled. Public reads and gates
passed, and a signed-in zero-score game over returned HTTP 200 without changing
the existing personal best or the five-row leaderboard. The exact frozen
generic-only revision remains ready at zero traffic, and a validate-only
etag-bound rollback check passed. The incompatible deferred-`main` trigger
remains disabled.

The mutating backfill and its operator command were retired after the legacy
column removal. The identity-free, read-only reconciliation remains because a
drop plan replayed against the fresh pre-drop backup must prove exact equality
before DDL. The completed cutover treated each reconciliation as one database
snapshot and separately recorded the Cloud Run drain, in-flight request wait,
authenticated proxy target, and pinned Cloud SQL server UUID.

The old empty-schema rollback and the one-time p4 grant-retirement
implementations were removed once their production-only jobs were complete.

## Developer tooling

See [`.vscode/README.md`](.vscode/README.md) for the tracked VS Code extension
recommendations, scoped MCP servers, authentication steps, security boundaries,
and verification workflow.

### Git hooks

Run once after cloning, from the repository root:

```powershell
npm run hooks:install
```

This activates the tracked `.githooks/pre-commit` hook, which normalizes
Unity-generated trailing spaces and tabs in staged Unity text assets under
`unity/three-bosses` before a commit is created. If normalization changes
anything, the hook intentionally stops that commit so you can review the
result and commit again; a Unity file that is only partially staged is
rejected instead of being modified. Unity can remain open as long as any
edited scene is saved before you start the commit and is not saved again
while the hook runs. Unity's canonical `ProjectSettings.asset` whitespace is
excluded so the Editor does not recreate formatting churn after every save.
See [`.githooks/README.md`](.githooks/README.md) for details, including the
`--no-verify` bypass.

Test the normalizer itself with:

```powershell
npm run test:unity-yaml-normalizer
```

## Unity project location

The Three Bosses Unity project is stored at:

```text
unity/three-bosses
```

Open that exact directory from Unity Hub with editor version 6000.3.8f1 and
allow the first import to finish. The project uses Visible Meta Files and Force
Text serialization. Its enabled build scenes are, in order:

1. `Assets/Scenes/Level1_BeeBoss.unity`
2. `Assets/Scenes/Level2_CyborgBoss.unity`
3. `Assets/Scenes/Level3_Kraken.unity`

Track `Assets/` with every `.meta` file, plus `Packages/`, `ProjectSettings/`,
and the project documentation. Unity-generated `Library/`, `Temp/`, `Logs/`,
`UserSettings/`, IDE project files, and builds are ignored and must not be
committed. See [`unity/three-bosses/README.md`](unity/three-bosses/README.md)
for controls, verification steps, and licensing links.

## Production architecture

- Firebase Hosting serves the frontend.
- Cloud Run serves the Express API.
- Cloud SQL stores application data.
- Production secrets are referenced through Secret Manager.

[`cloudbuild.deploy.yaml`](cloudbuild.deploy.yaml) is the repository's canonical
copy of Stage B's source-less inline configuration; the live trigger does not
read this file. Editing or merging it alone changes no trigger, Cloud Run
revision, traffic allocation, or score-submission state.

Firebase Hosting path redirects cannot canonicalize hostnames. The
`www.mickeyf.com` → `mickeyf.com` redirect is maintained in Firebase's external
custom-domain configuration and must be reverified there after domain or Hosting
changes.

Production deployments and IAM changes are separate, approval-gated tasks and
are not part of the local development workflow.
