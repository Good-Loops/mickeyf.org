/**
 * Frontend authentication service boundary.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - Wraps backend authentication endpoints into a small, typed API consumed by UI/context layers.
 *
 * Role:
 * - Owns request construction and response parsing for auth-related operations.
 * - Does not own UI state; callers (e.g., an AuthContext) decide how to store/derive authenticated UI state.
 *
 * Ownership boundaries:
 * - This module is responsible for fetch options (including cookie/session behavior via `credentials`).
 * - Callers own lifecycle concerns (when to call, how to handle loading/errors, and how to store any returned values).

 * Attempts to authenticate a user via the backend.
 *
 * Inputs:
 * - `payload.user_name` / `payload.user_password` are forwarded as-is to the backend; this function does not validate
 *   formats beyond typing.
 *
 * Side effects:
 * - Performs a `POST` request to the auth endpoint.
 * - Sends cookies/receives cookie updates by using `credentials: 'include'`.
 *
 * Output:
 * - Resolves to the parsed JSON response, typed as either `LoginSuccess` or `LoginError`.
 *
 * Error semantics:
 * - Rejects by throwing an `Error` when the HTTP status is non-2xx.
 * - Does not normalize JSON-level errors; any error shape in the successful JSON response is returned to the caller.
