/**
 * Defines the contract for a fractal-like PIXI animation that is driven by a host/ticker.
 *
 * A {@link FractalAnimation} is a small, self-contained render/update unit:
 * - **init** → called once to attach display objects and allocate resources
 * - **step** → called every frame on the host's ticker
 * - **scheduleDisposal** → arms a delayed disposal transition
 *
 * Separation of concerns:
 * - The animation owns its visuals and internal state.
 * - The host owns the PIXI app, ticker, canvas, and high-level lifecycle (swap/restart/dispose).
 *
 * This interface is intentionally minimal so implementations stay SRP-focused and remain easy to host.
