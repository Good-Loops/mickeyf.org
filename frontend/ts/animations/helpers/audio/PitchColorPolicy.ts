/**
 * Pitch → color “policy” layer.
 *
 * This module is responsible for mapping *stabilized* pitch inputs (and silence) into an HSL color
 * decision suitable for driving visuals.
 *
 * Separation of concerns:
 * - Pitch detection and confidence estimation live elsewhere (e.g. `AudioEngine`).
 * - Pitch stabilization (hysteresis / commit semantics) is handled by {@link PitchHysteresis}.
 * - This policy maps those stable inputs → aesthetic color decisions.
 *
 * Key goals:
 * - Musical coherence: stable pitch classes map to stable hue anchors.
 * - Stability: avoid hue flicker when pitch is noisy.
 * - Aesthetic continuity: allow small “micro drift” within a note, but keep it bounded.
 *
 * Hue in this project is expressed in **degrees** and generally normalized into $[0, 360)$.
 * Saturation/lightness are expressed as **percent** values (typically $[0, 100]$).
