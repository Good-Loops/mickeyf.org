# Clean Code inventory and teaching plan

## Baseline and scope

Recorded 2026-09-10 against `3af15ecbf18d0b277578f2488943648acbc70085`
(`main` after the p4-Vega release closeout). The baseline has **1,586 tracked
files**. This document is a new file beyond that baseline.

This is an ownership and subsystem inventory, with targeted source inspection
to choose the first refactor. It is **not** a claim that every implementation
has received a line-by-line review. No application code, dependency, database,
Unity asset, deployed service or running development process changed in this
pass. Completed release, device and package-script audits stay closed.

Reference: Robert C. Martin, *Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software
Craftsmanship*, the owner's local `C:\Users\User\Desktop\Pastas\Books\CleanCode.pdf`.
Consulted printed pages 35 (focused functions), 120 (dependency boundaries),
124 (readable tests) and 138 (responsibilities), corresponding to PDF pages
66, 151, 155 and 169. The book remains outside the repository. Its examples
are guidance, not rules requiring tiny functions, classes, wrappers or rewrites
where those would add more complexity than they remove.

## Tracked-file classification

The source of truth is Git's index, not a recursive scan of the working folder:

```powershell
git ls-files -z
git ls-files | Group-Object { ($_ -split '/')[0] } |
    Sort-Object Count -Descending
```

Every baseline path was assigned once using the boundaries below. Generated,
upstream, native and asset paths take precedence over general source/test/file
extension rules. The remaining 63 non-Unity tooling/configuration paths were
listed and inspected as a set; they are not an unclassified catch-all.
Counts total 1,586. Ignored dependencies, caches, local credentials, build
directories and out-of-repository evidence archives are outside this inventory.

| Class | Files | Boundary and treatment |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| First-party implementation | 313 | 208 frontend TypeScript/shaders/Sass and backend TypeScript files, plus 105 Unity runtime/editor C# and WebGL `.jslib` files. Review behavior-preserving changes by subsystem. |
| First-party tests | 76 | 67 `.test.ts` / `.test.mjs` files across frontend, backend and tooling; 9 Unity C# test files. Counts are files, not passing tests or coverage. |
| First-party tooling/configuration | 93 | 63 root/build/deploy/dev/editor/web configuration and tool files; 30 Unity project/package/assembly configuration files. Includes TypeDoc source CSS and the web manifest. Existing package-script audit is carried forward. |
| First-party documentation/references | 18 | Root and subsystem Markdown, agent instructions, design guidance, `docs-src/index.md`, and `resources/colors.txt`. Excludes upstream skill/license text and the captured tree below. |
| Protected schema migration history | 5 | `backend/migrations/0001` through `0005`. Do not rewrite or delete applied history. Executable migration/recovery code is included in first-party implementation, not assumed disposable. |
| Project-controlled native scaffolds/assets | 65 | Remaining `frontend/android/**` and `frontend/ios/**`, including Java/Swift entry points, example tests, resources and project files. Classify template remnants before changing them; preserve the Capacitor direction. |
| Project-controlled media/serialized content | 334 | 33 web artwork/audio/sprite-data files and 301 Unity scenes, prefabs, animation/material/data/settings/media files. Not conventional source refactoring targets; preserve references, attribution and embedded C2PA Content Credentials (provenance, not secrets). |
| Required Unity project metadata | 478 | Project `.meta` files outside the third-party group. These carry GUID/import settings and are not disposable generated junk. |
| Generated TypeDoc | 96 | `docs/**`. Change the source/configuration and regenerate when relevant; do not hand-refactor the generated site. |
| Generated Unity release | 5 | Four content-addressed files in `frontend/public/unity/three-bosses/releases/**` plus `build-manifest.json`. Preserve exact release bytes and provenance; use the release pipeline for changes. |
| Generated dependency locks | 5 | Four npm lockfiles and Unity `Packages/packages-lock.json`. Update through the appropriate dependency workflow, not a stylistic rewrite. |
| Generated Capacitor wiring | 2 | Android `app/capacitor.build.gradle` and `capacitor.settings.gradle`, explicitly marked generated. |
| Upstream tools/fonts/resources/notices | 95 | 11 Unity CLI skill files; 80 TextMesh Pro/Oxanium files including their metadata; `UNITY_COMPANION_LICENSE.md`; 3 Gradle wrapper files. Preserve attribution and update through upstream workflows. |
| Captured legacy directory listing | 1 | Baseline path `resources/project-structure.txt` contained stale paths and captured generated/dependency output. Retired after reference review on 2026-09-10; this historical baseline count remains unchanged. |

Ownership evidence for Unity content comes from
`unity/three-bosses/ASSET_PROVENANCE.md` and
`unity/three-bosses/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`; it is not a new legal review. Generated artwork is
still project content, unlike generated executable/build output. Native
scaffolding is not automatically third-party code to discard simply because
it started from a template.

### Subsystem review queue

All areas are inventoried; only the named candidate below has been selected
for implementation. Later entries remain review scopes, not a commitment to
refactor everything in them.

| Area | Review boundary | Current decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Leaderboard UI/data loading | `frontend/ts/pages/leaderboards`, hub page, transport/service boundary and route tests | First slice completed 2026-09-10: isolated the detail-state loader and its direct Node tests, described below. |
| Shared shell/forms/services/styles | `App`, `Header`, components, context, hooks, layout, auth pages/services and `frontend/sass` | Fourth slice completed 2026-09-10: auth transport separated from UI/configuration and session-response typing corrected. Next is the initial session-check lifecycle; preserve accessibility and accepted Safari behavior. Other shell/style areas remain review scopes. |
| Games | `frontend/ts/games`, game pages, help/results and bridge modules | Inspect responsibilities and lifecycles, preserving newly accepted gameplay, 1000-point policy, faster diagonal movement and touch/scroll boundaries. No generic release retest. |
| Animations/audio/math | `frontend/ts/animations`, music controls, shared utilities and public facades | Review ownership of renderer/audio/timing cleanup and pure calculations; retain artistic behavior. |
| Backend | `backend/ts` configuration, controllers, routers, middleware, repositories, security, migrations and public contracts | Second slice completed 2026-09-10: consolidated the duplicated Three Bosses mutation preconditions. Ordering, DTOs, gates, credentials and persistence remain unchanged. Other backend areas are still review scopes. |
| Unity | Custom `Assets/Scripts`, `Editor`, `Plugins/WebGL` and `Tests` | Review source responsibilities separately from serialized content. Any later scene/asset mutation uses the established Unity workflow and preserves GUIDs. |
| Native platforms | Android/iOS entry points, resources and configuration | Inventory complete; substantive review stays aligned with the native/PWA phase and available platform checks. |
| Tooling/configuration/docs | Root, `.github`, `.githooks`, `.vscode`, `scripts`, `docs-src`, `design`, `resources`, subsystem docs | Stale project-guidance slice completed 2026-09-10: corrected backend paths and retired the unused directory listing. Other tooling areas remain review scopes; preserve deployment boundaries and do not repeat the completed package audit. |

## First slice: isolate the leaderboard detail-state loader

### Before the refactor and the cost of its placement

At pre-refactor commit `86cd0cf4`,
`frontend/ts/pages/leaderboards/GameLeaderboard.tsx:13-90` defined the detail
state and loading decisions alongside the React page. The function already
accepts injected readers, which is a good foundation. However, its default
readers come from `leaderboardService`, which imports environment configuration
and constructs the configured API client.

Before-code, abbreviated only to show the dependency boundary:

```ts
// GameLeaderboard.tsx
export async function loadGameLeaderboardState(
    gameId: string | undefined,
    signal?: AbortSignal,
    readers: LeaderboardDetailReaders = {
        readCatalog: getLeaderboardCatalog,
        readGame: getGameLeaderboard,
    }
): Promise<SettledDetailState> {
    // Existing catalog selection, result validation and error decisions.
}
```

At that same commit, `leaderboardRoutes.test.mjs:16-38` starts Vite in middleware mode and loads
the `.tsx` module even for the injected-reader logic case at line 320. Vite
is appropriate for its JSX/view tests; it should not be required just to test
how a catalog/read result becomes `success`, `not-found` or `error`.

### Implemented change — 2026-09-10

The existing state/types/loader now live in adjacent
`frontend/ts/pages/leaderboards/leaderboardDetailState.ts`. It imports DTO types
and `LeaderboardRequestError` directly from `../../services/leaderboardApi.ts`,
not the environment-configured `leaderboardService`.

Actual new signature (the unchanged decision body is omitted here):

```ts
// leaderboardDetailState.ts
export async function loadGameLeaderboardState(
    gameId: string | undefined,
    signal: AbortSignal | undefined,
    readers: LeaderboardDetailReaders
): Promise<SettledDetailState> {
    // Same loading decisions; no React or environment-configured client.
}
```

The page supplies its already-existing real services explicitly:

```ts
const nextState = await loadGameLeaderboardState(
    gameId,
    abortController.signal,
    { readCatalog: getLeaderboardCatalog, readGame: getGameLeaderboard }
);
```

This is **dependency injection** in its simplest form: pass the collaborators
a function needs as arguments. No container, service hierarchy or generic
fetch framework is needed. The page owns the effect, retry, cancellation and
rendering; the loader owns the catalog/result-to-state decisions; the transport
owns HTTP and payload validation.

The benefit is not moving lines into a shorter file. It is making the
dependency boundary real and making the loader independently testable. The
loader is still asynchronous and performs I/O through its supplied readers;
it is not a mathematically pure function. The trade-off is one extra module
and explicit arguments at the call site, justified by independent logic tests.

### Preserved behavior and verification boundaries

- Keep catalog-first loading, no game read for missing/unknown routes, and the
  same AbortSignal passed to both reads.
- Preserve the rules-version mismatch error, `UNKNOWN_GAME` recovery links,
  selected-game context on ordinary errors and cancellation propagation.
- Keep the React effect's abort guard/cleanup, dependency array, retry callback,
  rendered markup, focus behavior, labels and table formatting unchanged.
- Use the same `LeaderboardRequestError` module identity within each test
  runtime; mixing a Node-loaded class with a Vite-loaded class can break
  `instanceof` even when their source is identical.
- Move the relevant existing loader assertions into direct Node tests; add
  focused signal/cancellation cases if missing. Retain Vite SSR view/hub tests.
  The full route suite still uses Vite: no claim that the entire suite becomes
  Vite-free or substantially faster.
- When implementing, run the complete relevant frontend checks once:
  `npm --prefix frontend test` and `npm --prefix frontend run build`, plus a
  bounded browser check of unchanged leaderboard rendering. No real accounts,
  score writes, database migration, Unity rebuild or device campaign is needed.

Finish that slice with a reviewed diff and commit/sync before choosing another
subsystem. Do not combine it with new caching, new state libraries, table
redesigns or backend authorization changes.

### Implementation closeout

The loader's decision body and the page's JSX/formatting functions were compared
with the previous commit and are text-identical. The page imports the extracted
loader, state type and existing cancellation predicate, and passes its real
readers explicitly. The transport, React effect lifecycle and UI are unchanged.

The test boundary changed from loading a `.tsx` module through Vite to:

```js
import { loadGameLeaderboardState } from './leaderboardDetailState.ts';

const result = await loadGameLeaderboardState('p4-vega', undefined, {
    readCatalog: async () => catalog,
    readGame: async () => { throw new Error('service unavailable'); },
});
assert.deepEqual(result, {
    status: 'error',
    game: p4VegaGame,
    message: 'service unavailable',
});
```

This test case uses fixed responses to exercise a failed game read. No browser,
real API request or database is involved. Existing logic assertions were moved,
not abandoned; cancellation, signal forwarding and missing-route cases were
added. The original hub/view tests remain in the Vite-backed route suite.

Checks actually completed:

- `node --experimental-strip-types --test frontend/ts/pages/leaderboards/leaderboardDetailState.test.mjs`
  — 13 passed independently of Vite/React/environment configuration.
- `npm --prefix frontend test` — TypeScript and all 185 tests passed.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` — passed; existing >500 kB chunk warning
  remains. No dependency or lockfile changes; the only package edit registers
  the new test file in the existing command.
- Browser: local p4-Vega detail → leaderboard hub → Three Bosses detail loaded
  and rendered their existing tables. This was read-only, not a new gameplay,
  authentication, score-write or physical-device campaign.
- `git diff --check` — passed. Independent read-only review found no boundary
  regression. No backend/cloud configuration, Unity content or deployment changed.

## Second slice: shared Three Bosses mutation policy — 2026-09-10

Before this refactor, `leaderboardController.ts` repeated the same four guards
in both ticket issuance and run submission: enabled flag, authentication,
trusted Origin, JSON content type. Each guard built its own versioned HTTP error.
Changing that policy required keeping two copies in sync.

Both handlers now start with this actual code:

```ts
const authorization = authorizeThreeBossesMutation(req, mutationPolicy);
if (!authorization.authorized) {
    return res.status(authorization.status).json({
        success: false,
        contractVersion: LEADERBOARD_CONTRACT_VERSION,
        error: authorization.error,
    });
}
```

The new `backend/ts/security/threeBossesMutationAuthorization.ts` owns only
those shared decisions. Its discriminated union exposes a trusted identity on
success, or a status/error on rejection. TypeScript therefore requires checking
`authorized` before reading `identity`. The controller still owns HTTP response
serialization, endpoint-specific payload validation, tickets and persistence.

This removes duplicate **policy**, not every repeated line. A small response
block remains in each handler deliberately; a generic response/middleware
framework would add more indirection than this change needs. The extra module
is justified by two real callers and direct policy tests, not by file length.

Order and exact responses are retained: disabled → 403 `SUBMISSION_DISABLED`;
authentication or Origin failure → 401 `UNAUTHORIZED`; non-JSON → 400
`INVALID_RUN`. Three Bosses keeps its existing 401 authentication-configuration
failure response, distinct from p4-Vega's 500. Existing authentication and
Origin validators are reused unchanged. Router limiter/JSON middleware order,
payload/ticket rules, database calls and response DTOs are untouched.

Checks actually completed:

- `npm --prefix backend test` — TypeScript passed.
- From `backend`: `node --test -r ts-node/register ts/security/threeBossesMutationAuthorization.test.ts`
  — 8 policy cases passed; registered in the existing `test:unit` command.
- From `backend`: `node --test -r ts-node/register ts/routers/leaderboardRouter.test.ts ts/routers/threeBossesRouter.security.test.ts`
  — 7 existing HTTP/router cases passed with fake persistence, including
  disabled-before-limiter behavior and both endpoint contracts.
- `npm --prefix backend run prod` — webpack production bundles passed.
- Independent read-only review found no actionable policy/wiring issue.

### Test command simplification approved in the same batch

`frontend/package.json` now uses
`tsc -p tsconfig.json --noEmit && node --experimental-strip-types --test "ts/**/*.test.mjs"`
instead of 19 explicit file paths. The quoted glob lets Node discover tests
without relying on shell expansion. Read-only set comparison found the exact
same 19 files, and `npm --prefix frontend test` passed TypeScript and all 185
tests. New matching test files are discovered automatically. No tests were
deleted, no dependency/lockfile changed, and the completed package audit was
not reopened. Local and CI Node versions are 22.23.2.

This batch did not repeat frontend builds/device tests or production submission
checks: frontend application source and production state were unchanged.
Generated documentation stayed unchanged; `git diff --check` passed.
## Third slice: retire stale project guidance — 2026-09-10

Corrected the five backend locations in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
For example, the old entry `backend/app.ts` is now `backend/ts/app.ts`.
The old "Database config" entry pointed to nonexistent
`backend/config/dbConfig.ts`; the guide now distinguishes the actual database
pool (`backend/ts/db/dbConfig.ts`) from validated environment configuration
(`backend/ts/config/**`). No application files were moved or modified.

Removed `resources/project-structure.txt` (586 lines) and its dedicated
`.gitattributes` rule. The captured tree mixed obsolete source paths with
`node_modules`, `dist`, Android build intermediates, APKs and logs. Tracked
reference search found no code, build or documentation-generator consumer:
only the attribute rule, inventory/roadmap notes and the listing's own name.
Git retains the old snapshot; no replacement tree or generator was added.

The principle is to document stable responsibilities rather than maintain a
second, manually synchronized filesystem inventory. Use Git/IDE discovery
for the current file list. The trade-off is losing an in-tree historical
snapshot, which remains recoverable from Git history. The original inventory
counts above intentionally describe their dated baseline, not today's count.

Validation: all 18 frontend/backend path references in the guide resolved to
tracked files/directories; tracked-reference search confirmed no remaining
consumer of the retired listing; `git diff --check` passed. No tests, builds,
dependency installs, server restarts or deployments were needed or run for
this documentation-only slice.

## Fourth slice: a consistent auth transport boundary — 2026-09-10

Login and session verification already used `authService.ts`, but signup
constructed its request in `SignUp.tsx` and logout did so in `AuthContext.tsx`.
That split left HTTP options, response parsing, form state and alerts mixed
across different layers. The service also omitted the verified username from
its session-response type, requiring an `any` cast in the context.

New `frontend/ts/services/authApi.ts` owns the four HTTP operations through
`createAuthApi(apiBase, fetchRequest)`. The configured `authService.ts` exports
those operations using the existing `API_BASE`; tests supply a fake fetch.
This follows the existing leaderboard transport/service split, without a
generic HTTP framework, new dependency or shared form component.

Before, signup constructed `fetch`, checked HTTP status and parsed JSON in
its submit handler. The actual replacement is:

```ts
const data = await signupRequest({
    user_name: userName,
    email,
    user_password: userPassword,
});
```

Its existing alert switch, success-only field clearing, loading cleanup and
JSX remain text-identical. Login's page is unchanged. Logout now delegates
to `logoutRequest()` but still clears local state on server/network failure.
Session verification now describes both real response shapes, allowing:

```diff
- setUserName((res as any).user_name ?? null);
+ setUserName(res.user_name ?? null);
```

The benefit is one testable HTTP boundary and explicit responsibilities, not
merely fewer lines. The trade-off is an extra module and factory; it has four
real operations and tests independent of React/Vite/environment configuration.
TypeScript response types describe the expected contract; they do **not** add
runtime JSON validation. Stronger payload checks, new 429 messaging and form
validation changes are not silently included in a behavior-preserving refactor.

Preserved contracts: exact endpoints and selected payload fields, password
whitespace, `credentials: 'include'`, HTTP-200 validation errors (including
duplicate-user `status: 409` in the JSON body), non-2xx rejection before parsing,
network/JSON failure propagation, no auto-login after signup, and existing
best-effort logout. Backend and public API behavior are unchanged.

Checks actually completed:

- `node --experimental-strip-types --test frontend/ts/services/authApi.test.mjs`
  — 9 focused transport tests passed, using fake responses only.
- `npm --prefix frontend test` — TypeScript and all 194 tests passed; the new
  file was discovered by the glob without another package-script edit.
- `npm --prefix frontend run build` — passed; existing >500 kB chunk warning.
- Source comparison confirmed the unchanged signup alert/state-cleanup/JSX
  section and unchanged Login page; `git diff --check` passed.
- No real accounts, auth requests, database writes, device campaign or backend
  build. No dependency/lockfile or generated-documentation changes.

Next bounded task: protect `AuthContext` from a delayed initial session check
overwriting a newer login/logout result. Its current mount request can settle
after those actions; this is a source-observed race opportunity, not a newly
reproduced production incident. Test with deferred fake responses, not accounts.

## Learning-oriented handoff for each future change

The owner requested on 2026-09-10 that improvements be taught, not merely
performed. Each implementation handoff should show:

1. The actual before-code and the concrete maintenance problem it creates.
2. The focused after-code/diff, explaining the principle and how this project
   uses it; distinguish code movement from a genuine dependency improvement.
3. Behavior preserved, relevant edge cases, verification actually performed
   and its limits. Label illustrative/proposed code clearly.
4. The trade-off, including when the same abstraction would be unnecessary.

For example, identical backend-looking configuration readers were not selected
for consolidation: runtime strings can trim whitespace, migration passwords
must preserve it, and cleanup credentials must not silently fall back to
runtime credentials. Similar syntax does not imply identical policy.

## Inventory closeout

Read-only Git/path enumeration, local reference reading and targeted frontend/
backend/tooling inspection completed. The classification sum covers all 1,586
baseline paths; no cleanup tooling or per-file generated manifest was added.
Only this inventory and roadmap documentation change in this pass. No tests,
builds, dependency installations or production checks were run because no
application behavior changed. Validation is limited to inventory consistency,
documentation links and `git diff --check`.
